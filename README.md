# BooyakaBot 2.0
Discord Bot themed after Rey Mysterio, for use on RIPTS

Things to add:
>Cron job
â€ºVoice Channel/Streaming capability

NOTE: Regenerate and replace the token in the json when "switching platforms" (ie windows to linux)

## I Have Overhauled this bot!!!
So yeah I'm starting anew, mostly to have a better file structure and make it more modular. "basic.js" contains all the first iteration code and can be run normally. (Maybe put it up on Pi4 for time being)
Bear with me while I tidy up :)
